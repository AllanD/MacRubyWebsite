We are glad to announce the release of MacRuby 0.10, after just a few weeks of development since the last release.
<% end %>
<%= RedCloth.new(@page.excerpt).to_html %>

This release brings support for new MacBook Pro hardware (Sandy Bridge processors), App Store submission fixes, and Xcode4 integration. Users of MacRuby are encouraged to upgrade.

You can download it from "here":http://www.macruby.org/files/MacRuby%200.10.zip. Please note that this package only works on Intel 64-bit machines running Snow Leopard (10.6) or later. Older Mac OS X versions are no longer supported. Intel 32-bit machines can be supported by manually building MacRuby from the sources.

Please give it a try and "let us know":/contact-us.html of any problems you find!

The "release notes":http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macruby-devel/2011-March/007390.html are available.

h3. Converging for 1.0

We are currently converting towards a first stable release of MacRuby, 1.0. We intend to deliver frequent releases until we reach that goal.

We do not expect further releases to include significant features, as we are now focusing on stability and compatibility issues.
