MacRuby development happens in the master branch of our "GitHub":https://github.com/MacRuby/MacRuby repository. However, be careful, because it may not work (or even compile) all of the time.

<pre class="commands">
$ git clone git://github.com/MacRuby/MacRuby.git macruby
</pre>

If you want to grab the sources of a specific release, look for the specific branch. For example, to grab the sources of the latest release:

<pre class="commands">
$ git clone -b 0.10 git://github.com/MacRuby/MacRuby.git macruby-0.10
</pre>

For building instructions, please refer to README.rdoc file, but the basic build instructions are:

<pre class="brush: js;">
$ rake
$ sudo rake install
</pre>

You can also "browse the repository":https://github.com/MacRuby/MacRuby online.
